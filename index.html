    <article class = "center" id = "bob">
        Modern stealth aircraft first became possible when Denys Overholser, a mathematician working for Lockheed Aircraft during the 1970s, adopted a mathematical model and creating a program called Echo1. Echo made it possible to predict the radar signature of an aircraft made with flat panels, called facets. 
        <br>
        In 1975, engineers at found that an aircraft made with faceted surfaces could have a very low radar signature because the surfaces would radiate almost all of the radar energy <strong> away </strong>from the receiver. Lockheed built a model called "the Hopeless Diamond", a reference to the famous Hope Diamond and the design's predicted instability. 
        <br>Because advanced computers were available to control the flight of such un-erodynamic aircraft, weapons like the stealth-bomber and the SR-71 spy plane have evolved. 
        <br>
        Nowadays, these aircraft have gotten prettier, but unfortunately no cheaper. One of the best stealth fighers ever built- the F-22 Raptor - costs 227 <em>million</em> to construct. Due to the exorberant cost, the US military cancelled the contract with Lockheed Martin, belaying further production of the F-22 and instead relying on the significantly cheaper F-35 Stealth figher.
